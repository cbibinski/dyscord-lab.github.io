bio: "<b>Gray Freeman Thomas</b> is a first year PhD student in the Ecological Psychology Ph.D. program within the Perception, Action, Cognition Division. He is affiliated with the Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action and the Connecticut Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences as well. Gray has received a Masters of Arts in Experimental Psychology from the University of Central Oklahoma where his research focused on the dynamic processes of prospective memory. His current research interests include Interpersonal synchrony during conflict, habit formation, dynamics of misinformation, leadership, motivation, generative practice, and team coordination dynamics. During his time with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), he researched high visual contrast for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) , knowledge, skills, and tests for UAS operations, crew and staffing requirements for UAS, human factors involved in risk-based decision making for aviation maintenance, safety culture in aviation maintenance, and maintenance human factors for integration into safety management systems (SMS). A common theme in his approach is promoting accessible, understandable scientific communication to a broader audience. In his free time, Gray hosts his own podcast dedicated to human connection and growth, and he also edits an NBA podcast. His labradoodle, Dawkins, is aptly named for the marriage between his love of basketball (Daryl Dawkins) and science (Richard Dawkins)."
