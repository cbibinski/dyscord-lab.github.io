The **dyscord lab** explores the
**dy**namics of
**s**ocial
**c**ommunication and inter-**or**ganism
**d**ependencies.
We investigate social interaction in a dynamical and ecological framework using
data-rich methods. We strive to conduct our science in a way that broadens
access to and resources for these approaches. We do this by adopting open-science
practices, by creating open-access resources, and by contributing to educational
efforts.

We are located in the
[University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/)â€™s
[Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psych.uconn.edu/), specifically
within the
[Perception, Action, Cognition division](https://psych.uconn.edu/perception-action-cognition-division/).
We are connected to
the multidepartmental [Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action](https://cespa.uconn.edu/)
and the cross-divisional [Social-Ecological and Environmental Lab](https://seelab.socialpsych.uconn.edu/).

## Joining the lab

We're looking for interested undergraduate students to join our lab as research
assistants! If the possibility of being a part of our community interests you,
[please fill out this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxCpwVgjQav5GtNbVnUdEvgmX7sY3qWOaNJ2HH4jndZF4Grw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Someone from our lab will reach out to you to follow up within a week (although
